    "> Due to the structure of the data (a list of lists of elements), neither list comprehensions nor piping seem to be a good fit for processing. Even with multiple comprehensions/pipes, the need to insert data as its own column and switch items around are complicated to implement. Hence an iterative approach is used instead, which will process an entire row of data at a time, rather than trying to apply a process to the same chunk of each line. A function/lambda expression could be defined for each step and used with comprehension/piping, but this just boils down to semantic differences (e.g. \"for l in lines: f(l)\" vs \"\\[f(l) for l in lines\\]\" vs \"lines >> map(f)\")."
